# RobotAnimation
Animated Robot made from scratch using C++ and openGL in xCode.


 Objective of Program:
 + In OpenGl, create an animated 3D hierarchical object.You must restrict the transformations applied to the object so that its behavior is a reasonable facsimile of its real world behavior; i.e. real elbows can't rotate 360 degrees.
 + Smooth, filled and colored 3D polygons must be used.
 + The figure must contain at least eight separate objects. These eight objects must define at least 4 parent/child relationships
 + A least one positional light must be used (diffuse or ambient).
 + You must define several new GLUT callback functions : GlutIdleFunction, GlutVisibilityFunction. The idle function defines the sequence of animations that the object goes through. The visibilty function defines when the object is visible.
 + You must add a menu to the Glut window environment for your application. Minimally the menu will allow the user to stop/start the animation and quit the application. You must write a function to handle menu selections.
 
 Controls:
 
 + To quit the program: Hit q or "esc"
 + To open screen menu: Right click
 + Screen menu options are as follows:
 + Start - starts animation
 + Stop - stops animation
 + Zoomin - zooms in on the robot
 + Zoomout - zooms out on the robot
 + Speedup - speeds up the animation
 + Slowdown - slows down the animation
 + Reset - resets the animation and zoom to original settings
 + Quit - quits the program
